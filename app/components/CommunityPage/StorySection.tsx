              <p>Copenhagen has no shortage of runners, but the culture around the sport felt closed off — PB-chasing, pace-obsessed, gear that looked like it belonged on a podium rather than a Sunday morning. We wanted somewhere you could show up, put in the work, and leave with people you actually wanted to see again next week.</p>
              <p>That&apos;s how the Sunday Socials started. No drop, no pace targets — just a loop through the city, coffee after, and space for everyone from first-timers to sub-three marathoners. It&apos;s the reason the brand exists, and it&apos;s still the thing we care most about.</p>

              <p>Around the Sundays, we build bigger moments. Marathon week activations, shakeout runs with visiting crews, pop-ups on race weekends, and capsule drops tied to the events that mean something to us. The gear comes from the runs, not the other way around.</p>
              <p>9TSEVEN is less a label and more an excuse to keep showing up. For the people already lacing up, and for anyone who&apos;s been waiting for a reason to start. The door stays open — we&apos;re just trying to widen it a little.</p>
